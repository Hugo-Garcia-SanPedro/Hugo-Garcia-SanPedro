# 👋 Hi, I’m Hugo

I’m a **Computer Engineering student** (3rd year) with a strong focus on **Deep Learning, NLP, and Algorithm Design**.

**My philosophy:** I love learning and building things **from the ground up**. Whether it's a GPT architecture or an Information Retrieval system, I enjoy diving deep into the fundamentals to understand exactly how technology works "under the hood."

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Building a GPT-style model from scratch using **PyTorch**, covering tokenization, self-attention, pretraining, and fine-tuning.
* **Deep Learning Theory & Implementation:** Exploring the core mechanics of neural networks, including manual implementation of tensor operations, automatic differentiation (autograd), and custom training loops.
* **System Design & Full-Stack:** Building scalable platforms that manage resources and services, focusing on clean architecture and efficient data management.
