# Hi there, I'm HUGO! 👋
### Computer Engineering Student | Deep Learning & NLP Enthusiast

I’m a 3rd-year student with a passion for **building from first principles**. I don't just use libraries; I dive into the math and logic "under the hood" to understand exactly how they work. My goal is to bridge the gap between abstract **Deep Learning theory** and robust **Software Engineering**.

### 🔭 Current Focus & Projects

- **🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs) from Scratch:**
  Building a GPT-style architecture using `PyTorch`. Implemented tokenization, multi-head self-attention, and custom training loops manually to master the Transformer architecture.
  
- **📐 Deep Learning Fundamentals:**
  Exploring the core mechanics of Neural Networks, including manual implementation of tensor operations and automatic differentiation (autograd) engines.

- **🌐 Full-Stack AI Integration:**
  Developing architectures that serve Deep Learning models via web interfaces (PHP/Python microservices), focusing on clean system design and resource management.
